# Inventory-Management-System
This is an Inventory management system built in python using json files.

The code of this Inventory Management System is mainly in two parts named :
1. [Adding_new_products.ipynb](https://github.com/Siddhi-Takawade/Inventory-Management-System/blob/main/Adding_new_products.ipynb)
2. [Purchasing_products.ipynb](https://github.com/Siddhi-Takawade/Inventory-Management-System/blob/main/Purchasing_products.ipynb)

### Adding new products
This contains the code to Read data from JSON, Add new items to Inventory, Manipulating the Quantity of the products present in the inventory records, Generating report of the json file using Pandas profiling.
Pandas profiling gives the 'records' dataset statistics and other details.
The report generated by pandas profiling is converted to pdf and attached above as 'records.json_report.pdf'

### Purchasing products
This part contains the code to Read Inventory, make purchases, generate Sales JSON file by appending all the purchases into 'sales.json', update Inventory after purchase, Generating report of the Sales json file using Pandas profiling.
Pandas profiling gives the 'sales' dataset statistics and other details.
The report generated by pandas profiling is converted to pdf and attached above as 'sales.json_report.pdf'

## Datasets
